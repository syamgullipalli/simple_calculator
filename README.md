# simple_calculator
A simple calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The basic idea of this project is to implement a javascript application following the ground rules:

* modular code
* separation of concern
* loosely coupled
* testable

[Publishâ€“subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) is used to make the application scalable and loosely coupled.
