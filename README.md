# simple_calculator
A simple calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The basic idea of this project is to implement a javascript application following the ground rules:

* modular code
* separation of concern
* loosely coupled
* encapsulate
* testable

[Publish–subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) is used to make the application loosely coupled. [AMD](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch11s02.html) pattern is followed using [dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/) for scalable application.
